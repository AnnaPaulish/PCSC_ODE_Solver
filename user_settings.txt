Y POLYNOMIAL COEFFICIENTS
    The Y Polynomial Coefficients are used to compute the right hand side of the ODE.
    The provided numbers, separated by commas, correspond to increasing powers of y
    If a certain power is not desired, simply place a 0 at the corresponding location

    Example for "Y Polynomial Coefficients: 1, 0, 4":
        RHS = 1 + 4 * y^2
