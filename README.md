# PCSC_ODE_Solver
In this repository we provide implementation of different solvers for the Project 2: "Ordinary Differential Equations" of the class Programming Concepts in Scientific Computing. 

# Introduction
This project focuses on implementation of numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial value.

We consider the following numerical methods:
- explicit methods: Forward Euler and the multistep Adams Bashforth (up to 4 steps);
-  implicit Backward Euler method;
-  explicit Runge-Kutta method.
